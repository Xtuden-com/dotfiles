run the shell script to convert the sqlite into an sql import statement
create the database in mysql
then do this:
mysql -p -u root cdc_phil_data < dump.sql
now our data is in sql so that php can understand it.

next, make the wordpress database.  then run this on it:
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_posts;
then use some python or shell (i'll probably write a script) to do this:
INSERT INTO wp_posts (post_type) VALUES ("page", "page");
where you have one "page" for every image id in our scraped database
that should do it!


The following sql does not insert.  It appears that the \u2013 (smartquotes?) is breaking the ' bracketing order. Caution not to kill the comma order.
