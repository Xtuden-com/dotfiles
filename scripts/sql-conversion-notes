run the shell script to convert the sqlite into an sql import statement
create the database in mysql
then do this:
mysql -p -u root cdc_phil_data < dump.sql
now our data is in sql so that php can understand it.

next, make the wordpress database.  then run this on it:
TRUNCATE TABLE wp_posts;
then use some python or shell (i'll probably write a script) to do this:
INSERT INTO wp_posts (post_type) VALUES ("page", "page");
where you have one "page" for every image id in our scraped database
that should do it!
